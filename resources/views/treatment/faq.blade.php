                                <h1><strong><em>Frequently Asked Questions About Substance Abuse Treatment at Rosecrance</em></strong></h1>
                    <p>At Rosecrance, we know that substance abuse treatment works. With treatment, clients get well; they embrace a renewed sense of hope, and they achieve lasting recovery.</p>
                    <p>We also know that, as you consider treatment at Rosecrance for yourself or your loved one, you have questions. Here are questions about substance abuse treatment we are frequently asked.</p>
                    <h2><strong><em>What is substance abuse therapy?</em></strong></h2>
                    <p>If you are a substance user or if you are addicted to a substance, you’ll need a specialized type of therapy. To be effective, substance abuse therapy must identify and address the underlying causes of the user’s behavior.&nbsp;Treatment also should teach patients how to identify high-risk situations and triggers, and how to develop the skills to prevent a relapse. The goal of treatment, which can include group and/or individual therapy sessions, is to help each patient achieve lasting recovery.</p>
                    <p>Substance abuse treatment may begin with a detoxification (or detox) process. During detox, the body eliminates the toxic influences of drugs or alcohol.&nbsp;The detox experience can be different for different people, depending on the specific type and frequency of substance used and the patient’s personal characteristics. Many substance withdrawal syndromes can be very unpleasant and potentially risky, so medical supervision is a vital part of the detox process.</p>

                                <h2><strong><em>Does Rosecrance cure addiction?</em></strong></h2>
                    <p>There is no cure for addiction. In fact, recovery from substance use is an ongoing, lifelong process. However, Rosecrance’s evidence-based treatment, rooted in the <a href="/addiction-treatment/12-steps">12-Steps</a>, helps patients manage their addictive behaviors successfully.&nbsp;As our client, you’ll learn how to navigate daily life without using substances. We’ll help you as you overcome the challenges of addiction.</p>
                    <h2><strong><em>How long does recovery take?</em></strong></h2>
                    <p>Treatment and the recovery journey are different for each person, and the amount of time you need may be different than someone else. While treatment duration varies based on an individual’s situation and needs, studies have found that patients who spend longer in treatment programs have better — and more lasting — rates of recovery.</p>
                    <h2><strong><em>What is included in a treatment plan?</em></strong></h2>
                    <p>Rosecrance counselors consider many factors when developing a treatment plan, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The history and severity of the addiction</li>
                    <li>The specific substances used</li>
                    <li>Any other medical or mental health conditions</li>
                    <li>Each client’s physical, mental, emotional, social, cultural, and spiritual needs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2><strong><em>What do clients tell their employers about treatment?</em></strong></h2>
                    <p>Deciding what information, if any, to share with your employer, is your personal choice. Federal law <u>does not</u> require you to provide details about treatment to your employer. However, state laws vary. Some employers offer a confidential Employee Assistance Program, which can be very helpful.</p>
                    <p>It’s important to be aware that, in some cases, an employer may automatically be notified if a claim is filed for state or private disability insurance. In those cases, employers can require a physician’s note authorizing the employee to be out of work, and the employee may need documentation to prove fitness for duty prior to returning to work.</p>
                    <h2><strong><em>What is discharge planning?</em></strong></h2>
                    <p>As you or your loved one progress through the recovery process and nears the end of treatment, Rosecrance staff will develop a plan for maintaining lasting recovery.&nbsp;This is called discharge planning, and it may include making connections in the community that can help promote long-term success. We make connections with support groups and therapists, and will assist with special living arrangements, if needed.</p>
                    <h2><strong><em>Is confidential help available?</em></strong></h2>
                    <p>All addiction counselors and treatment providers are required by federal regulations to maintain confidentiality. No professional counselor is allowed to release or give out any person’s health information without that person’s direct consent.</p>
                    <p>Respect for confidentiality is at the core of any reputable counselor’s practice and of any organization’s treatment program. That’s why no information about anyone in treatment can be released by telephone or any other means without the signed consent of that person, except in the case of a court order as specified by the regulations.</p>
