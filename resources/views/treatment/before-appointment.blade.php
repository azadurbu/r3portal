                        <p>Once you and your Doctor decide that surgery is the next step in your journey, you’ll work together to set expectations and create a post-op treatment plan to optimize your results. Understanding the process and your role in it will help you recover quicker, with less risk of complications.</p>
                        <p>When preparing for surgery, you’ll cover the following with your surgeon:</p>
                        <h2>An overall summary of your injury/ailment.</h2>
                        <p>This is why you’re here! Let the doctor know when it occurred, what exacerbates the issue or causes you pain, and how long you’ve been living with it. It’s also beneficial to let your surgeon know what treatments you’ve tried in the past.</p>
                        <h2>Medical History</h2>
                        <p>Your medical history is always important when seeking treatment, but it’s especially crucial that you share this information with your surgeon. Your medical history should entail any current or previous medical problems and any procedures that resulted.</p>
                        <h2>Family History</h2>
                        <p>Your family history is requested to help determine if there are any other factors to be considered when developing your treatment plan – both before, during, and after your procedure. Are there any medical conditions or diseases that are especially prevalent in your family? Has anyone in your family had complications from antibiotics or anesthesia?</p>
                        <h2>Current Medications</h2>
                        <p>Along with your medical and family history, it’s key that you share the Current Medications you are taking – both prescription and over-the-counter. If you’re taking any kind of dietary supplements, include those with your current medication – along with how often you take them.</p>
                        <h2>General Allergies</h2>
                        <p>While this may not be new information, it’s important that you disclose any allergies you have, no matter how minor or obscure. Whether it’s a major allergy like penicillin or a minor one, err on the side of caution and let your surgeon know.</p>
                        <h2>X-Rays, Images, and other information from past appointments</h2>
                        <p>This information is especially important if the appointment was with another surgeon or physician. If possible, bring (or provide access to a portal containing) copies of your medical records, including any kind of scans, imaging, or anything else you have access to that may help the surgeon understand the complete picture.</p>
                        <h2>Your Questions.</h2>
                        <p>We understand that surgery can be stressful. If you have any questions about the procedure, let us know! If you have any questions concerning ongoing treatment after the fact, overall recovery, or even the logistics of leaving after your procedure has taken place, write them down and bring them with you. We’re happy to address your concerns and help put your mind at ease.</p>
